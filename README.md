=============

Scala chess move generation and validation.

The project is in a primordial state. Pieces are placed on a board and moves can be generated and validated according to the rules of chess.

Getting Started ♕
-----------------

* Setup the latest version of SBT;
* Clone this repository;
* Setup IntelliJ IDEA 12;
* Run `sbt update gen-idea` from the project root;
* Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA 12;
* Run the *chess.scala* script in the *script* directory; 

The *chess.scala* script randomly selects a move, prints the move and makes the move in an infinite loop until you terminate it.

Design Principles ♗
-------------------

The code aims to be approachable rather than perform well. That trade-off may shift with time.
